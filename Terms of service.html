      The nature of blockchain technology permits complete freedom with censorship resistivity, however, Typeearn holds the power to suspend individuals found to be attempting to game the system one way or the other; ranging from the using multiple Steem accounts, using bots or malicious wares, or moving tokens from one account to the other to facilitate illicit TPC mining. Failure to comply with these may cause complete suspension from our system and adding the accounts to our backlist. This restricts such users from accessing our future incentives.
      
      <p><h4>Content</h4></p>
      We do not own any content appearing on the #Typeearn tag on Steemit.com except content from the official account @Typeearnblog. All other contents found on the tag, even when they seem to be official announcements solely belong to the original authors, and it is thus their responsibility to decide and control whether their contents are displayed on the tag.
      
      <p><h4>Uses</h4></p>
      We do not display contents for now. Although you can write contents through our interface, all contents are derived from and made accessible to the public through the Steem blockchain. Our website, unlike many other Steem DApps, is not meant for content reading but to bring about a unique functionality which contributes to the users’ progress in the real world via the Steem blockchain.
      
      Typeearn level badges; Ostrich, Penguin, Swan, Bustard, Pelican and Flamingo show the amount of TPC a user is holding in the wallet and, denotes mining rate. We only display such badges when you visit the user profile on our website, not on Steemit. Besides, the levels have nothing to do with the user’s Steem Power.
      
      <p><h4>Accounts Sign-up</h4></p>
